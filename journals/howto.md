Make a folder for each month and one document for each week. Never work in advance.

_Daily Headings_
In the weekly document, you should have a heading for the current day and any previous day; avoid adding headings for the future (that's what calendars are for.) Pro tip: prefix line items under each daily heading with the project name, for easier searchability. Example:

```
- Hellblazer: create experiment for pending reservation dates
- Summit: Create presentation on senior devs
- Code clinic: examples for code show-and-tell
```

_Soon Heading_
You should also have a heading for `Soon`, which are action items on your backlog. It's fine to arrange them in priority order but don't stress too much over this.

_Reminders_
I also have a heading for `Reminders`, which consist of actionable feedback that I have received or goals for myself relating to my interactions with others.

Inside the personal and work journal folders are files called `retrospectives.txt`. I recommend filling out the work version on Friday at the end of your day, and the personal version on Sunday evening. This is a personal retrospective that gives you a place to reflect on your overall feelings about your week, what you accomplished, the people who helped you the most, and also the people that you helped. Take your time filling these out-- self-reflection goes a long way toward a sense of accomplishment and reinforces your good work.
