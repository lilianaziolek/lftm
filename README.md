A low-friction task management system.

## Background
I have tried every GTD approach and software application under the sun. Without fail they fall into two camps: not enough organization, or far too much organization. I finally developed a system that works well for me, is low-friction, and keeps me organized (even though by nature I am a very disorganized person.)

The system has several benefits:
  * Answers the question of 'what do I do next?', which is the ultimate productivity killer.
  * Keeps my working memory uncluttered.
  * Keeps me from um'ing during my daily standups. I always know what I worked on yesterday.
  * Is a handy record of accomplishments that I can reference when it's time for my review, I want to ask for a raise, or I'm updating my resume.
  * Provides a reminder that I do, in fact, get things done and that I don't, in fact, suck at my job.

The system consists of a number of folders, each containing a specific kind of text file. I use BBEdit and open the parent folder as a project so that I have all of my subfolders in a tree view with easy access to their enclosed documents. You should be able to do the same thing in the editor of your choice.

It's important to keep these as plain text files. Don't do markdown or anything like that; this will increase friction. Plain text is faster, and faster means that you'll actually use the system.

## How to Use The Journal
When you start your day, pull a couple of items from your `Soon` heading up into the current day. As you work, take a few seconds to update the daily heading with what you're working on. Write down every task you completed or started, even if it feels minor. This will reinforce that you are a productive person and give you confidence in your ability to Get Shit Done.
