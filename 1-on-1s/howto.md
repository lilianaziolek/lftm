Keep a separate document for each person with whom you have 1-on-1s. Make date headings, and keep it updated with things that you want to talk about on that date.

Before your 1-on-1, open the document to review your last session and remind yourself of the things that you want to talk about.

During the meeting or immediately afterward, write down anything else that you talked about and capture action items. After the meeting is over, transfer the action items to your work journal under the `Soon` heading.
